One of the crucial elements of pursuing Photography is understanding to use Earth's natural light sources ( Sun ) to our advantage. A trick to naturally take better photographs is to shoot in the Golden Hour. As the name suggests this begins approximately an hour before sunset.

In order to assist Photographers with planning of their photoshoots, this application provides Rising & Setting time of Sun. Rising & Setting time will be referred to as Phasetime hereafter.

Phasetime is calculated using an Algorithm (link is provided ). Implementation is based on date and location ( longitude and lattitude ) as an input. User can provide the desired location using a Search Bar, move the Red pin or the Application will use current GPS location as default. For quick access, Application is able to show past persisted locations by the user.
